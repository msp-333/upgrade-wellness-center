    "overview": "A quiet, restorative lounge designed for deep rest. Many guests use EES to downshift from an ‘always-on’ day into a calm, reflective state—similar to meditation or a mindful nap.",
    "whatItIs": "A set of screens arranged to create a specific electromagnetic environment sometimes described as “bio-scalar fields.” We present EES strictly as a relaxation modality—no diagnosis, treatment, or promises of medical outcomes.",
    "benefits": [
      "Encourages a relaxed, parasympathetic state",
      "A deliberate break from screens and notifications",
      "Pairs well with breathwork, meditation, or journaling",
      "A gentle way to mark the transition from day to evening",
      "Many guests report easier wind-down before bedtime"

      "Arrive a few minutes early; store your phone and settle in.",

    "howItWorks": {
      "summary": "Guests often ask about the “why it feels so calm.” A commonly referenced idea is the Schumann Resonance (~7.83 Hz), which overlaps with relaxed Alpha/Theta brainwave ranges associated with meditative, pre-sleep states.",
      "details": [
        "Alpha/Theta: Linked with relaxed, dreamy states—periods the body naturally favors for repair and integration.",
        "Cellular charge: In simple terms, calm states support healthy cell-membrane potentials (often cited ~70–90 mV).",
        "Why “Scalar”? Some describe anti-phase coherence—similar to noise-canceling, where opposite waves flatten a signal. The concept suggests the resulting field feels still and spacious."

      "plainLanguage": "Think of a purpose-built quiet room: fewer distractions, gentle lighting, and permission to do nothing—so your system can exhale."
