    "overview": "EES provides a quiet, restorative lounge experience. Many guests use it for deep rest, meditation, or reflective downtime.",
    "whatItIs": "Screens are arranged to create a specific electromagnetic environment sometimes described as 'bio-scalar fields'. We frame EES as a relaxation modality—not a diagnosis or treatment.",
    "benefits": [
      "Encourages a relaxed, restful state",
      "Time away from devices and notifications",
      "Pairs well with sleep and mindfulness habits"
    ],
    "sessionFlow": [
      "Arrive a few minutes early and settle in.",
      "Set a simple intention (rest, breathwork, quiet).",
      "Recline with optional eye mask and blanket.",

    "howItWorks": {
      "summary": "Many guests are curious about the 'how'. A commonly discussed reference is the Schumann Resonance (~7.83 Hz), which overlaps with relaxed Alpha/Theta brainwave ranges associated with calm, meditative states.",
      "details": [
        "Alpha/Theta states: Often linked with relaxed, dreamy, pre-sleep experiences—times when the body prioritizes repair and recovery.",
        "Cellular charge: In simple terms, a relaxed state supports healthy cell membrane potentials (typically cited as ~70–90 mV).",
        "Why 'Scalar'? Some use 'scalar waves' to describe fields created by anti-phase coherence (like noise-canceling: opposite waves flatten a signal). In concept analogies, the 'flat' result still carries energy redistributed in a different form."
      ],
      "plainLanguage": "Think: a quiet room designed for deep calm—less 'doing', more 'allowing'."

    "howToPrepare": [
      "Dress in comfortable, layered clothing (you may cool down as you relax).",
